# AWS Projects 🚀

## Overview

Welcome to my AWS Projects repository!

As a **Cloud Enthusiast** and a **former Mainframe Engineer transitioning into Cloud Engineering**, I've curated this space to showcase real-world, production-level AWS projects that I’ve implemented to automate, scale, and secure cloud infrastructure. With hands-on experience using services like **EC2, VPC, S3, IAM**, and tools like **Terraform** and **CloudFormation**, this repository reflects my growing journey and skills in the cloud ecosystem.

All projects are developed in an anonymized environment, with "Hodan School" representing a fictional client. These examples mirror best practices in **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** and cloud architecture, developed while preparing for and after achieving my **AWS Cloud Practitioner** and **Terraform Associate** certifications.

## Tools & Technologies

To provision and manage infrastructure reliably and efficiently, I use:

- 🛠 **Terraform** – for writing declarative IaC to manage AWS infrastructure with consistency and automation.

## Project Highlights

- 🌐 Real-world AWS architecture & automation use cases  
- 📜 Clean, reusable Infrastructure as Code using **Terraform**
- 🧩 Modular builds designed for scalability and integration  
- 🔒 Sanitized project configs to maintain data confidentiality  
- 📘 Step-by-step implementation notes and architecture breakdowns  

## Why This Repository?

This repo serves as both:
- 📖 A personal knowledge base as I continue growing toward a Cloud Engineer role in Australia
- 💡 A reference for peers and future teams looking to troubleshoot or implement similar cloud solutions

## Upcoming Projects

Here’s a glimpse of what's coming:
- ✅ VPC with public/private subnets using Terraform  
- ✅ EC2 Auto Scaling and Load Balancer setup  
- ✅ Secure S3 bucket configurations with versioning and lifecycle policies  
- ✅ IAM role-based access control setup  
- ✅ Serverless architecture using Lambda and API Gateway
